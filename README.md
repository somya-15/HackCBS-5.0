# HackCBS-5.0

## Problem Statement
 A platform for college students to optimise their learning during exams by relevant material. 

There is an overload of study resources during examinations for students. Due to the fact that the internet and books are filled with a lot of content that might not be relevant, the study efforts often do not meet the expected performance in the exams as students miss important topics from important resources. With their exam time constraint and the need to cover exam-relevant content as a priority, students fail to decide which resources and topics are most relevant for them to cover.
We aim to provide concise study material with relevant resources.
